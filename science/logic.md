The purpose of science is that makes equations to predict phenomena and solve equations by substituting measured values.\\
Equations are the formula that contains unknowns. It is true if the unknowns are the specific values.\\
That is the equation is the Conditional proposition.\\
The specific values that makes equations true are called **solution**.\\
In other words, The purpose of science is that get the solution of physical problems.

For solve the equations, we need to transform the conditional proposition to the proposition.\\
To be specific, we will transform the equation to the function or indentity.
